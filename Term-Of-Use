Purchase, Subscriptions, and Auto-Renewals

Free Trials

We offer free trials at our discretion. Upon the end of a free trial (if applicable), you'll be required to pay the respective subscription fees to continue using the advanced features.

Subscriptions and Fees

Regardless of whether your subscription is weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or of another duration, it will automatically renew for the same period length upon its expiration unless you actively cancel. If you've purchased the subscription via the App, you can cancel or manage the auto-renewal at any time in the Appâ€™s account settings following the policies of the respective App Marketplace.

Subscription Cancellation

Uninstalling our app does not equate to a subscription cancellation. If you decide to cancel your subscription within an active period, fees already paid for that period will not be refunded. You will retain access to the subscribed features until the end of that subscription period.

Fee Adjustments

We may adjust the subscription fees at our discretion. Any changes in the subscription fees won't be applied retroactively.

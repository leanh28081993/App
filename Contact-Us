Our goal is simple: to create a product that not only works, but works well for you — one that’s useful, seamless, respectful of your privacy, and continuously evolving based on your feedback and real-world needs.

If you encounter any issues while using the app, have questions about its features, experience unexpected behavior, or simply want to share suggestions for improvement, we genuinely want to hear from you.

Whether it’s a small bug, a usability concern, or a big idea — your voice matters. Every message we receive is read carefully, and every piece of feedback helps shape the future versions of this app. We’re not just building a product — we’re building a community-powered experience, and you’re at the heart of it.
